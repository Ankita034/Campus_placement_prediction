# Campus_placement_prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of a student getting placed during campus recruitment using machine learning models. It analyzes various factors such as academic performance, technical skills, and extracurricular activities to determine the placement outcome. The model is trained on historical student data and predicts whether a student will get placed or not, helping institutions improve their training programs.
